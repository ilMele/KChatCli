# KChatCli

I'm new in socket / network programming so i tried to create a simple chat that uses UDP hole punching.

## client

Type your name, press enter and type the name of who you want to chat with, pres enter, wait the user does the same thing and chat.
At any time (except while waiting), you can press ESC to exit.
